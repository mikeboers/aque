Overview
========

- sync tasks could spawn threads, so Task.run() should have a timeout?
    - start all of the dependencies and children, and then wait for them all to be non-pending
    - will need to move the linearize logic into the run method
- only retry tasks that errored; re-use successful results
- error handling for sync tasks
- resuming sync tasks
- async running
