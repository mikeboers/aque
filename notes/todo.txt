- aque-xargs should match as much of xargs as we need
- aque-kill should kill a task
    - `aque-kill -r` would kill all dependencies

- make it easier to not kill your production database when testing

- worker should be able to schedule a listener on the broker for when there
  are new tasks so that it can immediately wake up

- fork before running tasks
- do we need a Broker.post_fork() to make sure redis is okay?

- document relationships of queues, brokers, task prototypes, and futures.
