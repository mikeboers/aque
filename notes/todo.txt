Overview
========

- sync jobs could spawn threads, so Job.run() should have a timeout?
    - start all of the dependencies and children, and then wait for them all to be non-pending
    - will need to move the linearize logic into the run method
- only retry jobs that errored; re-use successful results
- error handling for sync jobs
- resuming sync jobs
- async running
