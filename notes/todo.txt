Overview
========

- Make a simple Task class, which inherits from dict. This won't do anything
  very fancy, and won't understand how to talk to brokers in general.
    
    - Task.freeze() -> copy for serializing
    - use yaml.add_constructor to do the above automatically

    - Task.dependency_ids() -> list of ids of children and dependencies

- relationships of queues, brokers, tasks, and futures.

- sync tasks could spawn threads, so Task.run() should have a timeout?
    - start all of the dependencies and children, and then wait for them all to be non-pending
    - will need to move the linearize logic into the run method
- only retry tasks that errored; re-use successful results
- error handling for sync tasks
- resuming sync tasks
- async running
    - submit all of the dependencies and children to the queue first
