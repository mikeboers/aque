- aque-xargs should match as much of xargs as we need

- worker should be able to schedule a listener on the broker for when there
  are new tasks so that it can immediately wake up

- fork before running tasks
- do we need a Broker.post_fork() to make sure redis is okay?

- both result and exceptions go into result field

- document relationships of queues, brokers, task prototypes, and futures.

Distant Future
--------------
- consider migrating to RabbitMQ
